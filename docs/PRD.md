# Budgetin - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

A cross-platform budget tracking application that helps users manage their personal finances with a focus on web-first development while maintaining mobile compatibility.

## Technical Architecture

### Project Structure

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with feature-first organization:

- **Core Layer (`/lib/src/core`)**: Contains all core functionalities
  - Network handling
  - Routing
  - Theming
  - Localization
  - Utilities and Constants
- **Feature Modules (`/lib/src/features`)**: Each feature is self-contained with its own:

  - Data layer (data sources, repositories)
  - Domain layer (models, use cases)
  - Presentation layer (providers, pages, widgets)

- **Common Components (`/lib/src/common`)**: Shared functionality across features

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** Flutter with Dart
- **State Management:** Provider package
- **Network Layer:** Dio for HTTP requests
- **Dependency Injection:** GetIt
- **Platform Support:** Web (primary), iOS, Android
- **Architecture Pattern:** Clean Architecture with MVVM

### Core Features Organization

1. **Authentication Feature (`/lib/src/features/auth`)**

   - Sign Up/Sign In functionality

2. **Transaction Feature (`/lib/src/features/transaction`)**
   - Transaction History Table
   - Quick actions (Add, Edit, Delete)

## Core Requirements

### 1. Platform & Design Requirements

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**

  - Primary focus on Web deployment
  - Support for iOS and Android platforms
  - Responsive design architecture for all screen sizes

- **User Interface**
  - Implementation in `/lib/src/core/styles`
  - Responsive web design
  - Mobile-friendly interface
  - Consistent experience across platforms

### 2. Authentication System

- **Implementation Location**: `/lib/src/features/auth`
- **User Authentication Methods**

  - Email and password-based authentication

- **Authentication Flow**
  1. First-time Users:
     - Welcome page display
     - Options to Sign Up or Sign In
  2. Returning Users:
     - Direct access to Sign In page
     - Automatic sign-in if valid session exists

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dependency Injection

- Centralized injection setup in `/lib/src/core/utils/injections.dart`
- Feature-specific injections in respective feature directories
- Common dependencies in `/lib/src/common/presentation/app_injections.dart`

### Error Handling

- Centralized network handling in `/lib/src/core/network/`
- Centralized error handling in `/lib/src/core/network/error`
- Custom error types and handling mechanisms
- Consistent error reporting across features

### Logging

- Implementation in `/lib/src/core/utils/log/app_logger.dart`
- Different log levels for development and production
- Structured logging format

## Future Enhancements

1. Manual language selection in Settings
2. Manual theme selection in Settings
3. Additional authentication methods
4. Enhanced security measures
5. Offline support
6. Data synchronization
