Make sidebar hideable.

Make a right sidebar for add transaction. Make it slide in from the right.

Place "+" button as a card on account page. When pressed user can add new account and add it to the list. "+" card will be placed
at the end of the list.

Fix sorting "To" column in transaction list. It sorts the column based on the ASCII value of the characters. For example "a" comes
after "Z" which is not correct. Save user's input with toUpperCase() for simplicity.

When there are no transactions, place the "+" button in the center of the screen.
